Questions:

* How do we get to know what type of "vehicle group" a certain vehicle belongs to?
A car could be an emergency vehicle but might aswell be a military or diplomat vehicle. 
There needs to be extended logic implemented on how to check what type a certain vehicle is. 


* From what system will this functionality be called?


* What is appropriate return data? Enough with cost as an integer?


* Will incoming info on the vehicle be of type or registration number?
